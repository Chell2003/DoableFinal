    <p class="lead text-center mb-5">
        What started as a freelance project has grown into a nationwide software company helping auto repair shops thrive through technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        It all began as a freelance project when a shop in Quezon City approached us, looking for a system to help manage their business. That small project became the foundation of something much larger.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2017, the software was redesigned to serve general auto repair shops and was originally named <strong>Auto Shop Office</strong>, inspired by the idea of creating an “office suite” built specifically for shop operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        To reach more users, a website was launched and online ads were run. A partnership was formed, and together we registered our first business name, <strong>HENNIK Automotive Software Solutions</strong>, with the DTI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our very first client placed their trust in us, and through continuous feedback, we refined the system and expanded our user base. Growth was steady as we personally visited shops, conducted demos, and learned directly from our customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        As more features were added and more clients came onboard, the workload increased. Eventually, one partner moved on, but development continued — leading to a major breakthrough when a leading auto repair franchise adopted the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        This success inspired the next chapter. The business was officially registered with the SEC under a new name: <strong>Qonnec Software Solutions, Inc.</strong> As the product evolved into a more data-driven and intelligent platform, it was rebranded as <strong>Autometrik</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, Autometrik powers around <strong>200 auto repair shops</strong> across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Qonnec continues to grow, innovate, and stay true to its mission — helping automotive businesses become more efficient and connected through technology.
